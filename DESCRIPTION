Description: Non-negative Matrix Factorization(NMF) is a powerful tool for identifying the key features of microbial communities and a dimension-reduction method. When we are interested in the differences between the structures of two groups of communities, supervised NMF(Yun Cai, Hong Gu and Tobby Kenney (2017),<doi:10.1186/s40168-017-0323-1>) provides a better way to do this, while retaining all the advantages of NMF -- such as interpretability, and being based on a simple biological intuition.
